    id="test1",
    stem="A client is found unresponsive with no palpable pulse. What should the nurse do first?",
    options={
        'A': 'Check blood glucose',

## Components

### 1. Core TISM Framework (`tism_tree_final.py`)

The main implementation with the 4-stack hierarchy:
- **Life Threats (ABC+D)**: Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability
- **Safety**: Falls, Infection, Violence
- **Physical Needs**: Glucose (minutes), Pain (hours), Nutrition (days)
- **Nursing Process**: Assessment wins ties

Features:
- Machine learning integration
- Exception handling (EXCEPT, AVOID questions)
- SATA (Select All That Apply) support
- Debug mode for transparency

### 2. Machine Learning System (`tism_learning_system.py`)

Continuously improves TISM through:
- Pattern success tracking
- Keyword association learning
- Mistake analysis
- Adaptive weight adjustment

```python
# The system automatically learns from each prediction
tism = TISMTreeFinal(enable_learning=True)
# After each prediction, if correct answer is known:
# System records success/failure and adjusts patterns
```

### 3. Clinical Knowledge Base (`clinical_knowledge_base.py`)

Comprehensive nursing knowledge including:
- Normal value ranges (vitals, labs)
- Medication effects and contraindications
- Disease patterns and priorities
- Clinical decision rules

### 4. Question Validation Framework

Tools for processing NCLEX questions:
- Extract priority questions from datasets
- Validate question formats
- Analyze question types
- Performance metrics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Prediction

```python
from tism_tree_final import TISMTreeFinal, StudentQuickReference

# Print the student reference card
StudentQuickReference.print_card()

# Use TISM for prediction
tism = TISMTreeFinal(debug=True)  # Debug mode shows reasoning
result = tism.predict(question)
```

### With Clinical Knowledge

```python
from tism_with_clinical_kb import TISMWithClinicalKB

# Enhanced TISM with clinical knowledge
tism_kb = TISMWithClinicalKB(debug=True)
result = tism_kb.predict(question)
```

### Validation and Testing

```python
from extract_and_test_priority_questions import PriorityQuestionExtractor
from comprehensive_tism_analysis import run_comprehensive_analysis

# Extract priority questions
extractor = PriorityQuestionExtractor()
questions = extractor.extract_from_json('your_questions.json')

# Run analysis
results = run_comprehensive_analysis(questions)
```

### Machine Learning

```python
# TISM learns automatically when correct answers are provided
question.correct_answers = {'B'}  # Set correct answer
prediction = tism.predict(question)

# System records:
# - Was prediction correct?
# - What patterns matched?
# - What keywords were present?

# View learning statistics
from tism_learning_system import TISMLearningSystem
learning = TISMLearningSystem()
stats = learning.get_pattern_statistics()
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# AI Knowledge (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
AI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
AI_TEMPERATURE=0.3
TISM_AI_KNOWLEDGE=true

# Learning System
TISM_LEARNING_DB=tism_learning.db
TISM_ENABLE_LEARNING=true
```

### Settings

Adjust TISM behavior:

```python
tism = TISMTreeFinal(
    use_ai_knowledge=True,    # Enable AI knowledge helper
    enable_learning=True,     # Enable machine learning
    debug=True               # Show decision process
)
```

## Validation Tools

### Extract Priority Questions

```bash
python validation/extract_priority_questions.py --input questions.json --output priority_only.json
```

### Run Comprehensive Test

```bash
python validation/comprehensive_tism_analysis.py --questions priority_only.json
```

### Analyze Performance

```bash
python validation/analyze_results.py --results test_results.json
```

## Machine Learning Details

The system learns in several ways:

1. **Pattern Success Tracking**: Records which patterns lead to correct answers
2. **Keyword Association**: Learns new keywords associated with each stack
3. **Weight Adjustment**: Adapts pattern weights based on success rates
4. **Error Analysis**: Special attention to mistakes for improvement

Learning data is stored in SQLite database and persists between sessions.

## API Reference

### NCLEXQuestion

```python
NCLEXQuestion(
    id: str,                    # Unique identifier
    stem: str,                  # Question text
    options: Dict[str, str],    # Answer options
    correct_answers: Set[str],  # Correct answer(s)
    format: str,                # 'single' or 'sata'
    question_type: str          # 'priority', 'assessment', etc.
)
```

### TISMTreeFinal

```python
tism = TISMTreeFinal(
    use_ai_knowledge: bool = True,
    enable_learning: bool = True,
    debug: bool = False
)

# Main method
prediction = tism.predict(question: NCLEXQuestion) -> Set[str]

# Get decision log (when debug=True)
reasoning = tism.decision_log
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Learning Database**: If corrupted, delete and let it rebuild
   ```bash
   rm tism_learning.db
   ```

3. **AI Knowledge Not Working**: Check API key in `.env` file

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see TISM's reasoning:

```python
tism = TISMTreeFinal(debug=True)
prediction = tism.predict(question)
for log_entry in tism.decision_log:
    print(log_entry)
```

## Performance

Based on validation with 68 priority questions:

- **Baseline (random)**: 22.1%
- **Original TISM**: 25.0% (+2.9%)
- **Context-Aware**: 26.5% (+4.4%)
- **With Clinical KB**: 27.9% (+5.9%)

Best performance on:

- Explicit priority questions: High accuracy
- Questions with clear ABC keywords

## Future Improvements

   - Add more medications
   - Include specialty-specific patterns
   - Integrate with medical databases

2. **Enhanced Machine Learning**
   - Deep learning integration
   - Transfer learning from expert decisions
   - Real-time pattern discovery

3. **User Interface**
   - Web application
   - Mobile app for students
   - Interactive learning mode

4. **Integration**
