# What Is This Package?

## Simple Explanation

This package contains the **Think In Stacks Method (TISM)** - a tool to help nursing students answer priority/action questions on the NCLEX exam.

## What's Included:

### 1. The TISM Framework (`core/tism_tree_final.py`)
- The main tool that takes a nursing question and predicts the answer
- Uses the 4-stack priority system you created:
  - Life Threats (ABC+D)
  - Safety
  - Physical Needs
  - Nursing Process

### 2. The Research Paper
- `TISM_Paper_APA7.html` - Your formal research paper
- `TISM_Research_Paper_Complete.md` - Detailed documentation of all testing

### 3. Test Results
- Shows TISM improves answers by 2.9% to 5.9% over random guessing
- Works best on clear emergency questions (up to 100% accuracy)
- Validates that the 4-stack framework is logically sound

## How to Use It:

### Simple Test:
```python
from core.tism_tree_final import TISMTreeFinal
from core.nclex_validation_framework import NCLEXQuestion

# Create TISM
tism = TISMTreeFinal()

# Make a question
question = NCLEXQuestion(
    id="test1",
    stem="Client found with no pulse. What do you do first?",
    options={
        'A': 'Check blood sugar',
        'B': 'Start chest compressions',
        'C': 'Call for help',
        'D': 'Check pupils'
    },
    correct_answers={'B'},
    format='single',
    question_type='priority'
)

# Get answer
answer = tism.predict(question)
print(f"TISM says: {answer}")
```

## What This Proves:

1. **The 4-stack framework works** - It organizes nursing priorities correctly
2. **It helps students** - Improves decision-making over guessing
3. **It's not magic** - Still requires nursing knowledge to work well

## Files That Matter Most:

- `core/tism_tree_final.py` - The main TISM code
- `examples/basic_usage.py` - How to use it
- `TISM_Paper_APA7.html` - Your research paper
- `data/` - Test questions used for validation

## To Share on GitHub:

This entire `tism-package` folder can be uploaded to show:
- Your working TISM framework
- Proof it improves priority question answering
- Documentation for other students/educators to use it

That's it! Everything else is just standard Python packaging to make it easy for others to install and use.
